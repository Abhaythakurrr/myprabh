# ðŸš€ Railway.app Deployment Guide for MyPrabh

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Code

First, make sure all files are ready:
```bash
cd MYPRABH
ls -la
# You should see: app.py, requirements.txt, railway.json, Procfile, templates/, static/
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `myprabh-mvp`
   - Description: `MyPrabh AI Companion Platform MVP`
   - Make it Public (for free Railway hosting)
   - Don't initialize with README (we have our own)

2. **Push your code to GitHub:**
```bash
# Initialize git in MYPRABH folder
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial MyPrabh MVP deployment"

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myprabh-mvp.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy on Railway.app

1. **Create Railway Account:**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Click "Start a New Project"
   - Sign up with GitHub (recommended)

2. **Deploy from GitHub:**
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your `myprabh-mvp` repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python Flask app

3. **Configure Environment Variables (Optional):**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your project
   - Click "Variables" tab
   - Add environment variable:
     - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your email app password (for notifications)
     - `FLASK_ENV`: `production`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Wait for deployment to complete (2-5 minutes)
   - You'll get a live URL like: `https://myprabh-mvp-production.up.railway.app`

### 4. Verify Deployment

1. **Check the live site:**
   - Click on your Railway URL
   - You should see the MyPrabh landing page
   - Test the early access form
   - Try creating an account

2. **Monitor logs:**
   - In Railway dashboard, click "Deployments"
   - Click on latest deployment
   - Check logs for any errors

### 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **Add custom domain:**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings"
   - Click "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain (e.g., `myprabh.com`)
   - Update DNS records as instructed

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails:**
   - Check `requirements.txt` is correct
   - Ensure all imports in `app.py` are available
   - Check Railway build logs

2. **App Won't Start:**
   - Verify `Procfile` exists with: `web: python app.py`
   - Check that `app.py` uses `PORT` environment variable
   - Review Railway deployment logs

3. **Database Issues:**
   - SQLite database will be created automatically
   - Database will reset on each deployment (use Railway PostgreSQL for persistence)

4. **Static Files Not Loading:**
   - Ensure `static/` folder structure is correct
   - Check Flask static file configuration

### Railway-Specific Tips:

1. **Free Tier Limits:**
   - $5 free credit per month
   - App sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - 500MB RAM limit
   - 1GB storage limit

2. **Persistent Database:**
   - For production, add Railway PostgreSQL
   - Update `app.py` to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
   - Add `psycopg2` to requirements.txt

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set `EMAIL_PASSWORD` for email notifications
   - Set `FLASK_ENV=production` for production mode
