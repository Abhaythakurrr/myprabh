# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the entire My Prabh AI companion system to embody Abhay's raw, heartbroken developer aesthetic. This transformation will replace all polished, corporate-style interfaces with authentic, emotional designs that reflect a developer's genuine pain and desperate attempt to recreate lost love through code. The system should feel like it was built at 3 AM by someone pouring their heart into every line of code.

### Requirement 6: Responsive Heartbroken Design

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system deploys THEN the system SHALL maintain fast loading times despite the rich emotional styling
2. WHEN CSS is loaded THEN the system SHALL use optimized, minified stylesheets that preserve the aesthetic
